# Cozy Tea Project

_Description:_ 

a challenge project from codecademy.com where I build a fictional tea shop website with HTML and CSS.

## _What I enjoyed throughout the project/What I've learned :_ 

- how to position text in front of a image using the z-index property.
- how I can position different types of elements (images, text, etc.) using margin: auto.


## _Challenges that I've experienced :_

- Positioning certain elements to get them exactly where they need to be.
- Nesting through elements until I get a specific element to be styled a certain way.


## _My approach :_

- looking over and referring back to the design spec that was provided to see what types of details is needed.
- planning out on how I'd go about designing each individual element on the webpage.
- asking for assistance from other developers and doing research on anything I may not know how to do.
